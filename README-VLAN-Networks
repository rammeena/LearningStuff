To create VLAN Networks below things needs to be considerd:
1. To configure VLAN networks, switch ports connecting with servers should be configured as trunk ports.
2. You can create a range of VLAN networks or single VLAN network in openstack on single interface of
   compute nodes and network nodes. In both cases interface connecting switch should be trunk interfaces.
3. If you are configuring a FLAN type of network then trunk ports are not required because FLAT networks do not tag traffic
   However VLAN networks tag traffic.
